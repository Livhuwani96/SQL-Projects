# Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) Projects 

# Overview
This repository contains my Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) projects, including scripts written in Transact-SQL (T-SQL), demonstrating my expertise in:
- **Data extraction & transformation**
- **ETL processes**
- **Performance optimization**
- **Database administration**
- **Reporting & analytics**

The scripts in this repository include stored procedures, query optimizations, and administrative tasks aimed at managing and improving SQL Server environments.
